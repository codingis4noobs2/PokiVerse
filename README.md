# Pokémon Data Analysis Chat Application

This chat application allows users to explore and analyze a Pokémon dataset using various data visualization techniques. The application provides an interactive chat interface between "Ash" and "May", where they discuss different aspects of the dataset and guide the user through the analysis process.

## Features

- **Dataset Display**: The application loads and displays the Pokémon dataset, providing a tabular view of the data.
