## Data Story
This project aims to explore and visualize the battle statistics of various Pokémon species using a [pokemon dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanpatil63/pokemon-dataset). The main goal of this project is to identify the Patterns/Trends & Relationships among the data, Also the project is designed in such a way that even newbies can easily understand the process of data analytics. This Project will even teach you the basics of data analytics as well learn the best practices used in the industry.

## Where to access
1. Streamlit(Hosted Online): [Pokiverse](https://pokiverse.streamlit.app/)
2. Download the Jupyter Notebook which is inside of jupyter_notebook folder.

## Features

- **Dataset Display**: The application loads and displays the Pokémon dataset, providing a tabular view of the data.

- **Basic Dataset Information**: Users can view basic information about the dataset, such as the number of rows, columns, and data types.

- **Type Distribution Visualization**: The application uses pie charts to visualize the distribution of Pokémon types in both Type-1 and Type-2 categories.

- **Stat Distribution Visualization**: Users can explore the distribution of Pokémon stats (such as Total, HP, Attack, Defense, etc.) using histograms.

- **Percentage Calculation**: The application calculates the percentage of Pokémon that have better stats than a user-specified value.

- **Top and Bottom Pokémon**: Users can find the top 5 strongest and weakest Pokémon based on their stats.

- **Stat Analysis**: The application provides a radar chart to analyze the stats of a selected Pokémon, allowing users to compare different stats visually.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used to build the application logic and data analysis functionality.

- **Streamlit**: The Python framework used for building the interactive web application.

- **Pandas**: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, used for loading and processing the Pokémon dataset.

- **Plotly Express**: A high-level data visualization library, used for creating pie charts and radar charts.

- **Matplotlib**: A popular plotting library in Python, used for creating histograms.

- **Seaborn**: A data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, used for enhancing the visual aesthetics of the histograms.
